## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of diabetes using machine learning models. Built as part of the **Intel AI for Youth** initiative, it uses real-world healthcare data to detect early signs of diabetes risk and aims to support faster, AI-based medical decision making.

---

## 🔧 Technologies & Libraries Used

- Python
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn (KNeighborsClassifier, train_test_split, StandardScaler)
- matplotlib, seaborn

---

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset includes medical data for female patients and contains the following features:

- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- BloodPressure
- SkinThickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction
- Age
- Outcome (0 = No Diabetes, 1 = Diabetes)

---

## 🔍 ML Techniques Used

- Data Preprocessing & Normalization
- Train/Test Splitting
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** Classifier
- Confusion Matrix for Evaluation
- Correlation Heatmap for Feature Analysis

---

## 📈 Outputs

- Accuracy score of model predictions
- Confusion matrix and visualizations
- Feature correlations via heatmap

## 🧪 How to Run

1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rishabh1925/intel-diabetes-predictor
```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook Intel_AI4Youth_Diabetes_Predictor_Notebook.ipynb
```

3. Make sure `diabetes.csv` is in the same directory or update the path accordingly.
